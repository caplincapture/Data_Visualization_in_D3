**Summary**


This project plots survey data from the Pew Research Center of people in Muslim-majority countries and Western countries.  Muslim people in Muslim-majority countries and non-Muslim Westerners were asked to associate 10 behavioral traits with the other group.  Four positive traits were surveyed, including honesty, tolerance, and generosity, and six negative traits were surveyed, including arrogance, greediness, and respect for women.  


Non-Muslims tend to hold a more favorable opinion of Muslims than vice-versa.  


**Design**


I chose an interactive grouped bar chart to represent the data, which I found provided the clearest way of elucidating the differences between respondent publics.  I  wanted to make a side-by-side comparison between Westerners and Muslims for each trait, and therefore grouped the bars by trait and colored them with a diverging color scheme according to respondent public.  I used neutral color tones to present the data without preference for one or the other respondent public, as less neutral tones may have conveyed.


The height of the bars is proportional to the percentage of the public answering affirmatively to the trait posed.  The percentage in agreement of each public can be compared to the adjacent bar.   I arbitrarily chose the axis labels’ orientation and distance from the chart based on my judgment of the best layout.   Additionally, a blurb indicating the percentage of respondents in agreement appears when the cursor hovers over a bar.  Pew Research represented the data in such a way that I couldn’t determine exact figures for the number of people who responded affirmatively to each question posed.  Therefore, for accuracy purposes, I did not include a tooltip indicating the size of the sample (e.g. “n=...”).   The description is included under the header.


**Feedback**

What do you notice in the visualization?
Easy to read, easy to understand what the graphic was meant to represent, easy to navigate to look for specific info.
What questions do you have about the data?
None
What relationships do you notice?
What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Non Muslims tend to have higher opinion of Muslims (i.e. lower rates of holding opinions re: Muslims re: negative traits, higher of positive traits) than vice-versa. 




**Nick**
The visualization is informative, easy to read and easy to understand.
What questions do you have about the data?
I wonder what questions the group who did the study asked during the survey.
What relationships do you notice?
What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
Muslims and Westerners view each other differently.  Westerners tend to think more highly of Muslims than vice-versa.
Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
No
Odd topic to represent graphically this way (maybe a little, if you need something critical).
Overall, good job. Simple and clear, gets the point across simply and directly.

I really like the colors.  It pops.  I do have to refer often to the rubric (Muslims re Westerners), but that's not bad, as the rubric is clear.


No design changes were made after gathering feedback.  A different color scheme was considered, but the original scheme conveyed a difference between the two respondent publics without preference for one or the other, as might happen in a scheme where one color was more alarming than the other.

What do you notice in the visualization?
I notice a lot of data and a lot of text - too much of both. I wanted a story - and I got data.  The ‘characteristic’ looks like the title’s conclusion and not an axis label.
 
What questions do you have about the data?
Why are the data points in the order presented, other than simply looking at highest response for Muslim country residents to lowest?  


 What relationships do you notice?
Eventually, I noticed that the gap between the West and Muslim countries is greatest on negative characteristics and more similar on positive ones.  It did seem odd - because the negative qualities seemed to be a stereotypical view of the capitalist west and the positive ones a stereotypical list of deficiencies that the West seems in the muslim world.


I also noticed that the desire to express a negative emotion seemed higher in Muslim world 
 
What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
The tolerance of the west is expressed in their reluctance to judge. It was about the west vis a vis the muslim world, but I didn't get insights into the specific picture that each group has of the other.


 
Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?


There was a disconnect of sorts between the answers given to positive qualities and negative ones, which were really just opposites.  I would have rather seen two different charts that highlighted how one group viewed the other and any nuance in that.   The conclusion is rather weak.
